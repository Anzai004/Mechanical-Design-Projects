# Mechanical Screw Jack — 3D CAD Model

**Developed by:** Monjyeeman Dutta

---

## Overview

This project involves the 3D modeling and assembly of a mechanical screw jack using AutoCAD. The goal was to develop a clear understanding of component-based modeling, mechanical assembly structure, and spatial relationships between parts.

The screw jack was chosen as it represents a fundamental mechanical lifting device and provides an excellent foundation for learning practical CAD design workflows.
